# solving-15-puzzle
Write a program in C implementing a blind search strategy, i.e. Iterative Deepening 
Search(IDS) and a heuristic search strategy, i.e. A* Search with graph search to solve the 15
puzzle problem using Manhattan distance as the heuristic. Your program should use the 
board configuration below as the goal state and lets the user input the initial/start board 
configuration.
